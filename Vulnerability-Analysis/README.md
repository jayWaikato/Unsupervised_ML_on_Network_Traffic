# Vulnerability Analysis (Anomaly Detection)

![Vulnerability Plot](Vul_Analysis.png)

## 🎯 Overview
This demo applies unsupervised techniques to detect anomalies in **network traffic data**. By analyzing features such as connection duration, byte count, and packet rates, we surface unusual flows that may indicate security threats or vulnerabilities.  
👉 Identify outlier points indicating potential threats.


## 📝 Brief Explanation
Anomaly detection finds points that deviate significantly from the norm. Common unsupervised approaches include:
1. **Statistical methods** – flag values outside a chosen percentile (e.g. >95th).
2. **Clustering-based** – any data point not belonging well to a cluster is an outlier.
3. **Isolation-based** (e.g. Isolation Forest) – isolates anomalies by random partitioning; anomalies require fewer splits.  
These techniques help surface unusual events in logs or metrics that may indicate vulnerabilities.
